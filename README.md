# Rhythm Plus - Splamei Client (New - Mobile)
This custom client for the [Rhythm Plus game](https://rhythm-plus.com) allowing you to play natively on your Android phone or tablet.
Rhythm Plus is a web-based vertical scrolling rhythm game (VSRG), you can make, play, and share any songs from and with anyone! The game can also be played on PC and other platforms with a working web-browser.
## Features

 - Native to Android
 - Easy to use
 - Notices for new info on Rhythm Plus
 - Alerts on new updates
 - 100% Open Source

## Compatibility
- The Android Version needs to be Android 8.0 Oreo or above (API Level 28+)
- Your device must also have the Android System WebView installed otherwise the client will crash
- Also you need an active internet connection and to be able to access the Rhythm Plus website (rhythm-plus.com) and the Splamei Network (veemo.uk)

## Installation

 - Downloaded the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/splamei/rplus-mobile-client/releases)
 - Open the APK file in the **file browser app that shipped with your device** as to protect from websites and apps installing malware
 - You might be prompted to allow the app to 'Install Unknown apps'. If so, enable it
 - Google Play Protect may want to scan the app. Allow it to scan because Play Protect will block the install otherwise. This shouldn't take long
 - The install should begin. The install should finish after a few seconds of the scan from Play Protect finishing
 - Find the app within your Android Launcher, open and allow notifications (used to alert you about notices and updates)
## Making your own client
If your using this code to make your own custom client whether that be for Rhythm Plus or another web app, I ask for you to please do the following:
 - Credit this client as the base (whether it be in the repo README or the app itself)
 - Replace or remove the update handling (and notice feature if you want)
 - Change the package name
 - If the client isn't for Rhythm Plus, please change the icons the client uses
 - Because this client is currently under the MIT Licence, you **must** acknowledge my copyright ( (c) 2024 Splamei ) and have your client under the MIT Licence too
## Contributing
I would love for people to help the clients development so any little contribution would go a long way!

## Splamei Network Notice
The Splamei Network is used to provide the following features to the client:
 - Checking for updates and alerting if so
 - Getting any notices and alerting if there's any new

The latest version of the client uses the 1.1 Splamei Network. This version does not save any data about the GET  requests used.

## FAQ
### Q) Is the client available on the Play Store?
Currently, no. I do have plan to have it on the play store but that won't happen for at least a few years.
### Q) I have an older Android device then 8.0 Oreo. Can I still use the client?
No. Because the client uses functions that only work on SDK Version 28+, any older Android device won't be able to run it. Even if you tried. You may want to try the [legacy version](https://github.com/splamei/rhythm-plus-splamei-mobile-client) of the client but that won't be updated anymore.
### Q) Will the client come to other platforms? (Windows, MacOS, iOS, Linux)
The client likely will also come to Windows and possible MacOS and Linux but not iOS since it would need to be sideloaded, which can only be done in the EU right now, and to get it on the App Store would require me to play ~$50 a year to Apple (which I don't want to do)
### Q) I want to make my own client. Can I do that?
Yes! Just make sure you follow everything stated in the 'Making your own Client' section
### Q) Is this client official?
No. But I am working on it!
